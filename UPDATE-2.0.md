# This is a guide on how to update from version 1.x to 2.0

## Upgrade to PHP 7.1 or higher

In order to use this bundle, you will need PHP 7.1 or higher.

## Replace fsi_ckeditor with ckeditor

Since we removed this form type, you will need to use an alternative, for example
[Ivory CKEditor Bundle](https://github.com/egeloen/IvoryCKEditorBundle).
